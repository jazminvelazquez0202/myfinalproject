    I have created a website about a huge worldwide issue; Poverty. I decided to do this website on the this horrible and tragic 
    issue because I feel passionatley that this is one of biggest issues ever. I will share information on this website about how 
    so many people deal with poverty worldwide and how it is affecting so many families causing so many sicknesses and even leading
    to death. I will be adding CSS into this website to make it look fun and unique. It will also contain links to make it easier to view 
    diffrent pages.
