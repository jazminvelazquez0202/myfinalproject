   <h2> 
    My name is Jamin Velazquez ans I have created a website about a huge worldwide issue; Poverty. I will be creating this website
    using what I have been learning in my Computer Science Class. I will be coding using html and making it unique with CSS. At first 
    learning how to code was really difficult because it was something so new, but after a lot of practice and lots of help I have now
    gained a better understanding on how to create websites. I definetly am not an expert because when I start something new I always 
    struggle for a while. Creating websites and using all the new tags has been very fun but kind of confusing at times. I think that this 
    class can definetly be helful to people and with practice anyone can learn a few new things!
  
    <ul> A few things I have learned in Computer Science Class:
    <li>What CSS is and how it is used</li>
    <li>How to link into different pages</li>
     <li>Layouts</li>
     <li>Creating small basic websites</li>
    <li>Using tags to make boxes and lists</li>
    </ul>
