   <center> What Is the Purpose Of the Home Page?</center>
   The purpose of this page is to tell you what this is and what I what I will be doing with this website. This page is the first to other
   three pages which I will be linking from here. This home page is being constructed off of what I have been learning in my Computer Science Class. I
   will be trying to use diffrent tags to make my page diferent and fun. I will be using the basics I have learned which are HtML(language of
   the computer/how to code) and CSS which is basically the "decorating" and "styling".
