 <h2>
There are millions of people in poverty worldwide.At least 80% of humanity lives on less than $10 a day. More than 80 percent of the world’s 
 population lives in countries where income differentials are widening. The poorest 40 percent of the world’s population accounts for 
 5 percent of global income. The richest 20 percent accounts for three-quarters of world income. This is a tragic horrible issue that needs
  to fix because people are dying, innocent children are dying and that is not okay. According to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to 
  poverty. And they die quietly in some of the poorest villages on earth, far removed from the scrutiny and the conscience of the world. 
 Being meek and weak in life makes these dying multitudes even more invisible in death.
